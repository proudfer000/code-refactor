# Horiseon Code refactor Project 

## Story
For this project i refactored the Codebase to follow accessibility standards so the site its optimized for search engines.

To accomplish this goal i changed the less specific tags ```<div>``` with semantic tags [Semantic-tags](./assets/images/semantic-tags.png), adding ```alt```attributes when needed, also changing the background color of certain elements to have a better contrast.

In addition i took the liberty to reorganize the structural elements to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, furthermore repaired broken links and condensed the css code into one more comprehensible and less cluttered.

## Examples

Here ill link some before and after.
